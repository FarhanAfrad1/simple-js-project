# Simple background color changer


In thsi project I have used  <b style="color:green">getElementByClassName</b> query selector gives a HTML collection. By default we can not use forEach
in HTML collection. That's why I converted it into an array by using <b style="color:green">Array.form()</b> method.Now it is an array and I can perform any array related task.
